# Contributions Guides

Here are instructions on how to set the environment and other contributions
guidelines.

## Base instructions

For first-time contributors:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Set your development environment
3. Create your working branch.
4. Run and pass the tests with `pytest`.
5. Sync and create a PR from your branch into the project's `development`
   branch.

For core maintainers (contributors with granted permissions after accepted PRs),
push changes directly into `development` branch.

## Pipeline

## Requirements

- Python >=3.13
- venv (or Conda)

## Repository workflow

Check the instructions on the README. If you have any doubt, feel free to open a
new issue.

## Setting up the development environment

1. Create the virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the libraries in your environment

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Now the environment is ready!
